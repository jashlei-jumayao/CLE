				<h2 id="significance"> Significance of the project</h2>
				<p>We made this project in order to for us to respect the dignity of life. Because the church believes that all human beings are imagebearers of God, it affirms the unique value of all human life. Mindful of the sixth commandment—"You shall not commit murder". Abortion is the same as commiting murder because we Christians believe that human life starts at conception. This project aims for people to have a better understanding of abortion and its effects. To help and guide the people who are planning on doing abortion. This also helps  people to become more careful because they know consequences of doing it.We hope to reduce the number of people who are going to commit abortion with this project.</p>

				<p><pre>

• To raise awareness to avoid future possibilities of a sudden rise 
in abortion rate.

<h2>The Beneficiaries</h2>
<p>The beneficiaries will be young adults who have yet to be aware of the consequences of their actions. Being able to hear what they will have to go through will make them more cautious with their actions. Those who have went through the pain of abortion could also benefit from this, they can provide their experience and advice, having been gone through it already. They can talk about what they felt, possibly being able to comfort one another.
</p>
<h2>Prayer</h2>
<p>Loving God, I come to you in need that please extend your arms those person who was being threatened to do abortion. Save them from the strong power of abortion that they may be happy with the babies with or without the presence of the father and with or without the support from their parents. May they’ll be responsible for their own doings and keep on thinking about the fruit of what they did. May the father take responsible of what they did because growing without a father is hard.</p>
