								<p> The relationship with their lover
may be severely damaged and
quite possibly destroyed
because of the regret they feel.
Their friendship with other
people will also be damaged
because of the choice they
made. But most importantly
their relationship with their
parents will be destroyed.
That single decision
will severe relationships
with the people will love
and quite possibly destroy
their entire lives.

<h2>
	What causes abortion?
</h2>
<p>Abortion is a problem that
has been increasing over the
past few years recently and
is caused by various things.
The most common cause is
financial problem. People
abort because they lack the
money needed to raise
children. Another cause is
very common and that is
teenage pregnancy.
Teenagers who get pregnant
often get abortions because
they cannot afford to take
care of a child or they are
too young to take care of a
child and are unable to take
care of them.</p>

<p>Some people get abortions
but because of the
financial issues but rather
something else like a disease
that the mother has and is
very weak when carrying the
child. In some causes they
would rather abort the child
rather than continue on
because there is a chance
that the mother will also die.</p>
<h2>What are the effects of abortion?</h2>
<p>Abortion can not only damage
the reputation of the persons
doing it but also damages the
society around them and how
they percieve them.
It damages the potential future
of the economy if they abort
someone because one day
that baby that was born
could contribute to our
society but can't because they
had been aborted. How
the people around the ones who
aborted see them get affected
by abortion and their reputation
can be tarnished.</p>
<p>Abortion can affect the churches
as well because the church
reject any form of abortion as it is
an act of murder and a sin.
It not only tarnishes the church
but your christianity as well.
Your status as a christian can
be damaged because
of what you had done. It is
essentially severing the link of
your loyalty to the church
because you had committed
a grave sin.</p>
<p>Abortion will greatly affect your
relationship with your family,
especially if you made that
decision on your own without
consulting them. Although not
everyone may have the luxury
of having a happy family, you
still need to consult their opinions.
Deciding on your own, could
sometimes lead to the
disappointment of your family
towards your decision, and will
only worsen your relationship
with them and their trust and
view of you. Since abortion is
mostly frowned upon, if you are
still a student going to school and
have already went through abortion,
it will not only affect how your peers
will look at you, but also your studies
.Some may not be so willing to be associate
with you anymore, not sure how they
should react on your decision.</p>
<p>This could affect how other people
view your family, spreading rumors
on how you were not raised well or
desciplined enough, that's why
you had go to abortion in the
first place. It could also cause
your parents to have a possibility
of losing their jobs, since some
work place are more conservative
than the rest and would try to avoid
as much issues as possible. Abortion
could also affect your school,
worsening their reputation
towards the general public since a
student who had to go through
abortion is far from common.
This could also affect their possible
applicants from enrolling in their school,
loosing the credibility
of their values.</p>
				<h2 id="significance"> Significance of the project</h2>
				<p>We made this project in order to for us to respect the dignity of life. Because the church believes that all human beings are imagebearers of God, it affirms the unique value of all human life. Mindful of the sixth commandment—"You shall not commit murder". Abortion is the same as commiting murder because we Christians believe that human life starts at conception. This project aims for people to have a better understanding of abortion and its effects. To help and guide the people who are planning on doing abortion. This also helps  people to become more careful because they know consequences of doing it.We hope to reduce the number of people who are going to commit abortion with this project.</p>

				<h2>Objectives:</h2>
				<p><pre>
• To educate people about what is usually the cause of abortion.
• To raise awareness to avoid future possibilities of a sudden rise 
in abortion rate.
• To comfort those who had to go through abortion with no other choice.</pre></p>
<h2>The Beneficiaries</h2>
<p>The beneficiaries will be young adults who have yet to be aware of the consequences of their actions. Being able to hear what they will have to go through will make them more cautious with their actions. Those who have went through the pain of abortion could also benefit from this, they can provide their experience and advice, having been gone through it already. They can talk about what they felt, possibly being able to comfort one another.
</p>
<h2>Prayer</h2>
<p>Loving God, I come to you in need that please extend your arms those person who was being threatened to do abortion. Save them from the strong power of abortion that they may be happy with the babies with or without the presence of the father and with or without the support from their parents. May they’ll be responsible for their own doings and keep on thinking about the fruit of what they did. May the father take responsible of what they did because growing without a father is hard.</p>
